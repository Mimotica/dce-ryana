DISCRETE CHOICE EXPERIMENT ANALYSIS - METHODOLOGY

Data Structure and Preparation
--------------------------------
The discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted with 95 respondents, each completing 8 choice tasks. Each choice task presented 3 alternatives: two product profiles and an opt-out option. This resulted in a total of 760 choice situations (95 respondents × 8 tasks) and 2280 observations in long format (760 × 3 alternatives).

The product profiles were defined by four attributes:
1. Comfort level (3 levels: 1, 2, 4)
2. Hearing aid performance (2 levels: PARTIAL, COMPLETE)
3. Speech understanding effort (3 levels: EASY, MODERATE, MORE EFFORT)
4. Visibility (2 levels: VISIBLE, INVISIBLE)
5. Price (continuous variable in euros)

Data preprocessing involved:
- Creating unique choice situation identifiers (csid) by concatenating respondent ID and task ID
- Converting price from string format to numeric (removing currency symbols and decimal separators)
- Identifying opt-out alternatives based on zero price and missing attribute values
- Effects-coding all categorical attributes to avoid perfect multicollinearity

Effects Coding
--------------
Categorical attributes were effects-coded rather than dummy-coded to ensure model identification and interpretability. For an attribute with K levels, K-1 effects-coded variables were created. The omitted level's utility is the negative sum of all other levels' coefficients.

Effects-coding applied:
- Comfort (3 levels → 2 variables): comfort_1.0, comfort_2.0 (reference: level 4.0)
- Hearing performance (2 levels → 1 variable): att_complete (reference: PARTIAL)
- Speech effort (3 levels → 2 variables): speech_easy, speech_moderate (reference: MORE EFFORT)
- Visibility (2 levels → 1 variable): app_invisible (reference: VISIBLE)

The coding scheme applied the traditional effects-coding rule:
- Present level coded as +1
- Omitted reference level coded as -1
- All other levels coded as 0

Multinomial Logit Model
------------------------
We estimated a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model using the pylogit package in Python. The utility function for alternative j in choice situation t was specified as:

U_jt = β_optout × OPTOUT_jt + β_price × PRICE_jt + 
       β_comfort1 × COMFORT1_jt + β_comfort2 × COMFORT2_jt +
       β_att_complete × ATT_COMPLETE_jt +
       β_speech_easy × SPEECH_EASY_jt + β_speech_moderate × SPEECH_MODERATE_jt +
       β_app_invisible × APP_INVISIBLE_jt + ε_jt

where:
- OPTOUT_jt is an alternative-specific constant for the opt-out option
- PRICE_jt is the price in euros
- Other variables are effects-coded categorical attributes
- ε_jt follows an i.i.d. Type I extreme value distribution

All parameters were specified with alternative-invariant coefficients (i.e., "all same" specification), assuming homogeneous preferences across the sample population.

Model Estimation
----------------
Parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) via the Newton-Raphson optimization algorithm implemented in pylogit. Model fit was assessed using:
- Log-likelihood at convergence
- Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
- Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)

Statistical significance of coefficients was evaluated using t-statistics and p-values from the asymptotic normal distribution.

Willingness to Pay Calculation
-------------------------------
Marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for each attribute level was calculated using the ratio of the attribute coefficient to the price coefficient:

WTP_level = -β_level / β_price

For effects-coded attributes, the utility of the reference level was calculated as:
β_reference = -(β_level1 + β_level2 + ... + β_level(K-1))

WTP values represent the marginal rate of substitution between the attribute level and price, interpreted as the amount in euros respondents are willing to pay to move from the baseline level to the target level, holding all other attributes constant.

Attribute-level WTP ranges were computed as:
WTP_range_attribute = max(WTP_level) - min(WTP_level) across all levels of the attribute

This range represents the total monetary value span of the attribute from its least to most preferred level.

Bootstrap Confidence Intervals
-------------------------------
To account for sampling uncertainty in WTP estimates, we employed a bootstrap procedure with 300 iterations. In each iteration:
1. Respondents were resampled with replacement (preserving within-respondent correlation across choice tasks)
2. The MNL model was re-estimated on the bootstrap sample
3. WTP values were recalculated from bootstrap coefficients

95% confidence intervals were constructed using the percentile method (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution).

Note: Due to convergence issues in some bootstrap samples (likely related to extreme resampling configurations), the bootstrap procedure may require adjustment of starting values or convergence criteria for robust CI estimation.

Software
--------
All analyses were conducted in Python 3.14 using:
- pandas (2.2.3) for data manipulation
- numpy (2.2.1) for numerical operations
- scipy (1.15.1) for statistical functions
- pylogit (1.0.1) for discrete choice model estimation
